# My First GIS Viewer
My First GIS Viewer
A minimal, web-based map viewer designed to help beginners learn the basics of GIS (Geographic Information Systems). This project demonstrates how to load and display geospatial data (e.g., GeoJSON) on an interactive map using lightweight JavaScript libraries like Leaflet or OpenLayers. You can optionally use Python tools (GeoPandas, GDAL/OGR, Shapely) to preprocess data before visualizing it on the client side.

Features
Interactive Map: Pan, zoom, and view geospatial features on a familiar web map interface.
GeoJSON Support: Easily load GeoJSON data to display points, lines, and polygons.
Optional Server-Side Processing: Use Python for buffering, intersection, and coordinate transformations.
Custom Styling: Style your map features (color, line thickness, popups) for better visualization.
Technology Stack
Frontend: JavaScript with Leaflet or OpenLayers (and basic HTML/CSS).
Backend (Optional): Python (Flask, GeoPandas, GDAL/OGR, Shapely) if you want server-side data processing or more advanced workflows.
Getting Started
Clone or Download this repository.
Open index.html in your web browser, or serve it via a local server (e.g., http-server or Pythonâ€™s http.server).
Load Your Data: Adjust the code to point to your own GeoJSON file or endpoint.
Explore: Pan around the map, zoom in/out, and click on features (if popups are enabled).
Next Steps
Add More Layers: Load multiple datasets and provide a layer control.
Spatial Analysis: Integrate Python or Turf.js for buffering, intersections, or advanced queries.
Projection Support: Handle different coordinate systems using Proj4Leaflet or by reprojecting data on the server.
